# Accounting System – Backend

Enterprise‑grade **Accounting & ERP backend** built with **Laravel**, designed with **SaaS scalability** and **enterprise architecture** in mind.

> This project is not a simple CRUD REST API. It focuses on **domain‑driven design**, **accounting correctness**, and **long‑term scalability** for real‑world business systems.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The system follows a **Modular Monolith** approach:

```
Modules/
 ├── Accounting/
 ├── Tenancy/
 ├── Users/
 └── ...
```

Each module encapsulates its own:

* Controllers
* Services
* Repositories
* Models
* Routes

This approach provides:

* Strong boundaries between business domains
* Easier refactoring and feature expansion
* A smooth transition path to microservices if needed

---

## 🏗 Multi‑Tenancy Strategy

* Each tenant (company) has its **own database**
* Tenant resolution handled at the application layer
* Prevents data leakage and improves performance at scale

This strategy is commonly used in **enterprise SaaS platforms** where data isolation is critical.

---

## 📊 Accounting Design

* Implements **Double‑Entry Accounting** principles
* Every transaction enforces:

  * Balanced debit and credit entries
  * Clear chart of accounts structure
* Designed to support:

  * Financial reports
  * Auditing
  * Future integrations (tax, invoicing, reporting)

---

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses **Pest PHP** for testing:

* Unit tests for core domain logic
* Integration tests for modules
* Focus on reliability of financial operations

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **PHP 8+**
* **Laravel**
* **MySQL / PostgreSQL**
* **Pest PHP**
* **Laravel Modules (nwidart)**
